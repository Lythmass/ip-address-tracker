# IP Address Tracker - Flashy App

This project uses an API which tracks IP address and locates it
on the map.
Link to the deployed app: https://lythmass.github.io/ip-address-tracker/

## How to use it
In order to get the location of an IP Address, type the
address in search input and click the enter button, which will
display the location on the map. To see the detailed information,
click the navigation button.
## Experience
After completing this challenge, I have improved at integrating an API to a React project, managing components and using styled components.
## Features

- Continent of the address
- Country of the address
- City of the address
- Responsive design
